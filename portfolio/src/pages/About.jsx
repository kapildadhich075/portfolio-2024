        My journey began in 8th grade, crafting web pages while playing
        state-level cricket as a fast bowler. Competing in hackathons as the
        youngest participant sparked my passion for tech. Pursuing a BCA degree,
        I balanced studies with internships across diverse roles, becoming a
        generalist skilled in problem-solving and adaptability. Now, Iâ€™m eager
        to focus my experience on building impactful software solutions.
